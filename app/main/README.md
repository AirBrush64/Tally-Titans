# Tally-Titans

Tally Titans Character Counter is a fast-paced counting word game where players must determine the number of distinct letters in a given word.

Objective: Players need to identify how many unique letters are in a randomly chosen word.

Gameplay:

- The game pulls a word from a database and displays it to the player.
- Players have 20 seconds to enter the count of unique letters for the displayed word. For example, "affection" would be counted as 8 distinct letters.
- Each game round lasts 20 seconds, and players can join ongoing rounds to participate and score.
- Players are allowed up to three attempts per word.
- A countdown timer is shown for each word to keep track of remaining time.
- Points are awarded based on the number of attempts and the time taken to answer. (The exact scoring method is flexible and can be developed as needed.)
- Players can view a high score list to see top performers.
- Game data, including words, scores, and player information, is stored in a database.

User Roles:

- Players: Can play the game, change their passwords, and view the high scores.
- Admins: In addition to player capabilities, admins can add, modify, or delete players and admins, as well as manage the word database (words must be at least four characters long).
